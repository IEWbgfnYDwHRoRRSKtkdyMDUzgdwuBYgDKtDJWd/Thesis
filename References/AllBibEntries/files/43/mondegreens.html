<b><font size="+2">Mondegreens Ripped My Flesh</font></b>
<p>

Here at the Center for the Humane Study of Mondegreens, we've 
been toting up the entries and applying the latest 
statistical correlative methods, even using our toes, to 
arrive at a semi-definitive answer.
</p><p>

We believe that the most frequently submitted Mondegreen is 
still "Gladly, the cross-eyed bear" (known in the real world 
as that fine old hymn "Gladly The Cross I'd Bear"). A close 
second is "There's a bathroom on the right," a mishearing of 
"There's a bad moon on the rise" from the old Creedence 
Clearwater song "Bad Moon Rising."
</p><p>

Third place is still firmly held by "Excuse me while I kiss 
this guy," actually "Excuse me while I kiss the sky" from the 
Jimi Hendrix song "Purple Haze." Mr. Hendrix was himself 
aware that he had been Mondegreened, and would occasionally, 
in performance, actually kiss a guy after saying that line.
</p><p>

Fourth place is probably occupied by Round John Virgin, a 
Shakespearean figure occasionally found in "Silent Night." 
Also high on the charts is a Mondegreen from "Groovin'", a 
popular song of an earlier era. (Kids, "groovin'" was kind of 
like "chillin'" except the clothing fit more tightly).
</p><p>

In that song, the Rascals were singing "You and me 
endlessly," but many people heard "You and me and Leslie," 
leading to speculation about the exact identity of Leslie and 
the popularity of multiple couplings in the music world.
</p><p>

For those of you who have not yet received the pamphlet 
(mailed free to anyone who buys me an automobile), the word 
Mondegreen, meaning a mishearing of a popular phrase or song 
lyric, was coined by the writer Sylvia Wright.
</p><p>

As a child she had heard the Scottish ballad "The Bonny Earl 
of Murray" and had believed that one stanza went like this:
</p><p>
<i>Ye Highlands and Ye Lowlands<br>
Oh where hae you been?<br>
They hae slay the Earl of Murray,<br>
And Lady Mondegreen.</i>
</p><p>

Poor Lady Mondegreen, thought Sylvia Wright. A tragic heroine 
dying with her liege; how poetic. When it turned out, some 
years later, that what they had actually done was slay the 
Earl of Murray and lay him on the green, Wright was so 
distraught by the sudden disappearance of her heroine that 
she memorialized her with a neologism.
</p><p>

This space has been for some years the chief publicity agent 
for Mondegreens. The Oxford English Dictionary has not yet 
seen the light, but it will, it will.
</p><p>

The pledge of allegiance is such a hotbed of Mondegreens that 
one could create a composite of submitted entries: "I pledge 
a lesion to the flag, of the United State of America, and to 
the republic for Richard Stans, one naked individual, with 
liver tea and just this for all."
</p><p>

This formulation is elderly enough to have predated "under 
God," which is just as well; it would be a shame to lose "one 
naked individual."
</p><p>

There are Mondegreens in familiar phrases. A friend of Adair 
Lara's believed for years that we live in a "doggy dog world" 
populated by pushy people with a "no holes barred" attitude, 
while a friend of Carolyn Stone's believed that World War II 
was fought between the Zees and the Not Zees.
</p><p>

B. Young was charmed to hear that both Coke and Pepsi came in 
"cheerleader size." Later, he was disappointed to learn that 
it was actually "two litre size." Florence Jarreth was 
interested in the new "Jeep Parakeet," but less interested in 
the new "Jeep Cherokee."
</p><p>

James Lauder recounted the story of the pet shop clerk who 
told him, in all seriousness, that her parents' wealth did 
them no good at all because they just sat around their 
backyard deck in Marin and "drank themselves to Bolivia."
</p><p>

Geoffrey Gould's mother was convinced that if, say, you were 
moving a vase to a high shelf because small children were 
about to come over, you were moving said vase "out of arm's 
sway." Stephanie von Buchau always believed, correctly, I 
should think, that "a soft dancer turneth away wrath."
</p><p>

But the overwhelming majority of Mondegreens come from song 
lyrics. Remember on the East Side and the West Side when me 
and Mamie O'Rourke "risked our lives in traffic"? Remember 
when Simon and Garfunkel sang hauntingly about how "partially 
saved was Mary and Tom"? Remember that touching moment in 
"I'm in the Mood for Love" when the singer reveals his 
favorite nickname for his beloved?
</p><p>
<i>I'm in the mood for love,<br>
Simply because you're near me,<br>
Funny Butt, when you're near me ...</i><br>
</p><p>

There was the Bob Dylan song with the memorable refrain: 
"Dead ants are my friends, they're blowin' in the wind." 
There was the great Crystal Gayle song "Doughnuts Make Your 
Brown Eyes Blue." There was the equally wonderful Maria 
Muldaur song "Midnight After You're Wasted."
</p><p>

Val Kruger heard Jose Feliciano's famous recording of "Feliz 
Navidad" as "Police naughty dog," and now so will you. Barry 
McCarthy mentioned another popular Spanish song, "One Ton 
Tomato." Melissa McChesney always heard "My baby likes the 
Western movies" as "My baby's like a wet sock moving."
</p><p>

Two great Paul McCartney Mondegreens: The lines of French in 
"Michelle" were heard by Kathy Stawhorn's daughter as 
"Michelle, ma bell, Sunday monkey won't play piano song, play 
piano song." Several people have heard the line in "Lucy in 
the Sky With Diamonds" that goes "the girl with kaleidoscope 
eyes" as "the girl with colitis goes by."
</p><p>

There are many more; many more -- I have envelopes stuffed 
with them. But our eyes grow weary and our stomachs grow 
hungry; we must now, in the words of the old Christmas carol, 
"sleep in heavenly peas."
</p><p>
