  abstract = {Amazon’s Mechanical Turk {(AMT)} is a Web application that provides instant access to thousands of potential participants for survey-based psychology experiments, such as the acceptability judgment task used extensively in syntactic theory. Because {AMT} is a Web-based system, syntacticians may worry that the move out of the experimenter-controlled environment of the laboratory and onto the user-controlled environment of {AMT} could adversely affect the quality of the judgment data collected. This article reports a quantitative comparison of two identical acceptability judgment experiments, each with 176 participants (352 total): one conducted in the laboratory, and one conducted on {AMT.} Crucial indicators of data quality—such as participant rejection rates, statistical power, and the shape of the distributions of the judgments for each sentence type—are compared between the two samples. The results suggest that aside from slightly higher participant rejection rates, {AMT} data are almost indistinguishable from laboratory data.},

  doi = {10.1109/ASPAA.2007.4393041},
  abstract = {Pop noise caused by plosives generated by talkers, singers and other vocalists has long been a topic of interest to microphone manufacturers. The articulation of speech plosives (oral-stop consonants such as p, t, and k) can severely degrade the quality of a recording or performance. This is especially true for pressure-differential microphones, where not only is the unwanted artifact heard, but also there is the high potential for either microphone or associated electronics overload. Traditional wind/pop shields made of foam or a stretched fabric have been in use for many years, and are adequate for most common applications. However, it may be desired or advantageous to use an electronic version of pop protection under conditions where a pop or wind screen is not practical or sufficient, such as when using a lapel or podium microphone that is designed to be visually unobtrusive. The results presented in this paper describe a relatively simple procedure to reduce microphone sensitivity to speech plosives via physically-informed signal processing methods, or Electronic Pop Protection {(EPP).} The {EPP} system itself comprises two parts: 1) detection of the presence of pop (turbulent air-jet flow) in the signal, and 2) suppression of this transient noise. A {DSP-based} demonstrator was created to illustrate and measure the operation of the algorithm on actual hardware. Finally, an objective evaluation of the algorithm is presented.},
