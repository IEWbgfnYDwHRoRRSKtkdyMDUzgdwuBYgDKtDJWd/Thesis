I know things seem hard right now, but I believe in you.  I believe that you'll 
get through it, and you'll be fine.  I believe in you, because I know that you've done this before,
and you'll do it again, because that's who you are. You are capable, and you are strong,
and you have something to share with the world. Now do it!


What will this day be like? I wonder.
What will my future be? I wonder.
It could be so exciting to be out in the world, to be free
My heart should be wildly rejoicing
Oh, what's the matter with me?

I've always longed for a masters
To do the things I've never dared
And here I'm writing my masters
Then why am I so scared

A thesis with eighty pages / A panel with three professors
What's so fearsome about that?

Oh, I must stop these doubts, all these worries
If I don't I just know I'll get flack
I must dream of the things I am seeking
I am seeking the courage I lack

The courage to write this with reliance
Face my defense without defiance
Show them I'm worthy
And while I show them
I'll show me

So, let my thesis have its problems
I'll do better than my best
I have confidence they'll put me to the test
But I'll make them see I have confidence in me

Somehow I will impress them
I will be firm but kind
And all those bugs, well, (Heaven bless them!)
They will resolve for me


And mind me, with each step I am more certain
Everything will turn out fine
I have confidence the world can all be mine
They'll have to agree I have confidence in me

I have confidence in sunshine
I have confidence in rain
I have confidence that spring will come again
Besides which you see I have confidence in me

Strength doesn't lie in numbers
Strength doesn't lie in wealth
Strength lies in nights of peaceful slumbers
When you wake up -- Wake Up!

It tells me all I trust I lead my heart to
All I trust becomes my own
I have confidence in confidence alone
(Oh help!)

I have confidence in confidence alone
Besides which you see I have confidence in me!
