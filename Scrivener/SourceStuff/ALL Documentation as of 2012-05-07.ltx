So. I bet you're all wondering what's happening with my thesis. If so, you fit 
into one of these groups:

1) you're working on a thesis? What's it about?

2) oh, that melody matcher thing you've been mumbling about for the past few years? 
How's that work again?

3) yeah, I know you're working on your thesis. I keep hearing you talk about all 
the gory details. But what does it look like?

4) But how do you know it really works?

I'll be addressing group \#3 today.

As you already know, Melody matcher is an algorithm that measures inherent understand 
ability of a song when sung by a person with a General America accent.

This is sort of a fudge, because the general American accent is not actually the 
accent that singers use while singing, nor is it the accent spoken by most americans. 
It's the newscaster accent, and is generally agreed upon to have come from somewhere 
in the midwest. ~It is heavy on understandability, and therefore fudges NO consonant 
or vowel sounds, whereas singers do this all the time. However, the alterations 
singers make to their phonemes while singing are not generally agrees upon, and 
there is no \texttt{"} singing accent\texttt{"}.

There are a few generally agreed upon rules about context -based pronunciation 
changes in singing:

\texttt{"}the\texttt{"}: if the word 'the' is followed by a word that begins with 
a vowel sound, it is then sung as \texttt{"}thee\texttt{"}, instead of 'thuh'

\texttt{"}and\texttt{"}: this one is strange, and I'm not sure about, but it often 
becomes \texttt{"}an' \texttt{"}

\texttt{"}a\texttt{"}: there a a few different ways this can be pronounced: \texttt{"}eh\texttt{"}, 
\texttt{"}uh\texttt{"}, or \_\_\_\_

Glottal stops:

Coda-pushing: it is generally agreed upon by most all singers that, when singing 
a word, you sing the vowel. ~This \texttt{"}vowel\texttt{"} can be more accurately 
described as the nucleus of a syllable

Anyway! Didn't meant to get bogged down in that. You're probably winding what my 
thesis end product actually *looks* like.

So, I like gardening. It's really obvious when you're doing something right with 
a plant, because it grows and florishes.

Warning: this is not a perfect metaphor.

So, for my thesis, I pretended that we live on a world where plants are nourished 
and grow by being fed music. ~Each tree feeds upon a single. ~The very first lyrics 
of the song cause the tree to begin to grow, the the tree stops growing when the 
song is over. ~You want a tall, green tree with few branches at the end, not a 
browning bush with way too many branches and forks. Like any good gardener, a good 
lyricist prunes back branches that are unwanted.

The growth rate of the tree depends upon the tempo of the song fed into it.

The tree splits off and creates new branches whenever a phonetic sequence can be 
understood in more than one way. For example, i stink, an ice cold shower. ~This 
means that the branch points must be on the phoneme level, and not on the word 
level.

The tree's color will remain green if all the words in the lyrics are a good fit 
for their notes. If there is any cramming or bleeding, then the tree branch for 
that sequence will be browned, depending on the severity of the cramming/bleeding.

How is this achieved?

0- we must substitute and account for pronunciation variations caused by singing 
the words instead of speaking them. This includes:

The/a/glottal-stops/coda-pushing

1- before we break our words into individual sounds, we much break them into syllables, 
and check for cramming and bleeding.

Abstract (System purpose and tasks to be performed):

This project aims to facilitate semi-automated composition of melody and accompanying 
lyrics, by way of matching the musical emphases of a piece with the textual emphases 
of the lyrical phrases.~The program will ultimately rely upon user input for \texttt{"}fitness\texttt{"} 
criteria, but will initially match lyrics with melodies based upon some rules.\label{HToc120798035}\label{HToc197578260}

Usage Domain and Environment:

This program will be used as a compositional aid by anyone who wants to write songs 
and make them sound good, technically.  Its should allow the song writer to focus 
on more subjective criteria of what makes a song ``good'', because it will make 
the structural rules of lyric composition immediately apparent.  The first version 
of this will probably be only for users that already understand the structural 
rules, unfortunately, because the composer must be able to understand that there 
IS a need to properly place lyrics in songs.  

The structural rules of lyric placement are important, because without them, lyrics 
can become muddled and/or unintelligible. For example, in the song ``Groovin' (on 
a Sunday Afternoon'', by the Young Rascals, there's a part in the bridge that everyone 
always hears as ``Life would be ecstasy, you an' me an' Leslie''.  In fact, the 
line is ``Life would be ecstasy, you and me endlessly''.  The confusion lies with 
the last three syllables of the phrase.  The pronunciation of each version, if 
spoken normally, is as follows:

\begin{longtable}{llll}
\hline
% ROW 1
\multicolumn{1}{|p{1.726in}|}{\begin{minipage}[t]{1.726in}\raggedright
and       Les-   lie\end{minipage}} & \multicolumn{1}{p{2.656in}|}{\begin{minipage}[t]{2.656in}\raggedright
end-       less-       ly\end{minipage}}\\
\hline
% ROW 2
\multicolumn{1}{p{0.059in}|}{\begin{minipage}[t]{0.059in}\raggedright
@nd   ``lEs     li\end{minipage}} & \multicolumn{1}{p{0.059in}|}{\begin{minipage}[t]{0.059in}\raggedright
``End      l@s       li\end{minipage}}\\
\hline
\end{longtable}

A `` preceding a syllable means that syllable is emphasized. 

So, in the first phrase, we see that the emphasis pattern goes something like dum-DUM-dum, 
where the first syllable of ``Leslie'' is emphasized.  The second phrase's emphasis 
pattern is ``DUM-dum-dum'', so the first syllable of endlessly is emphasized.

When words are put to music, however, the musical emphasis basically overrides 
the textual emphasis. Sometimes, if a previously un-emphasized syllable becomes 
emphasized, or a previously emphasized syllable loses its emphasis, the meaning 
of the phrase can change.

For ``Groovin''', the lyrics match up to the music in the song as follows:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=384pt, height=47pt]{ALL Documentation as of 2012-05-07-fig001.emf}
\end{center}

Life   would be  ec-            sta-    sy,        You  an'  me   end-  less- ly 

In all music, the emphasis always goes on the first part of a beat.  

In this case, in the first measure is emphasized for the notes that correspond 
to the lyrics, ``Life'', ``be'', ``ec-''(as in ec-sta-sy)  and ``sy''(again, as 
in ec-sta-sy) (This is a vast oversimplification, but it works for now). So, the 
lyrics would be emphasized as such:

Life would be ec-sta-sy

This musical emphasis matches the spoken emphasis of the phrase, so it is intelligible 
as a lyric.  (Though ecstasy's first syllable doesn't start on the first part of 
beat three, it is still on the first part of beat three, and therefore still emphasized. 
 Alternatively, since the first part of beat two didn't have a hard stop to it, 
the emphasis could have rolled over to the second part,  ``ec'', which does have 
a hard stop. These are the sorts of things I need to figure out formal rules for. 
 I only know them by intuition right now.)

In contrast, take the second measure:  the syllables ``You'', ``me'', and ``less'' 
are emphasized.  This leads to conflicting musical and spoken phrasing:

Musical Phrasing:\tab You and me  endlessly

Spoken Phrasing: \tab You and me  endlessly

The singer is now singing the phrase, syllable by syllable, which they think of 
as syllable-note combinations:

YOU and ME end LESS lee

The singer, for his part, is doing what many singers are taught to do, to make 
it easier to sustain the singing of words that end with unsingable consonants: 
the unsingable consonant is displaced onto the front of the next word.  In this 
case, the consonant ``d'' is not singable, so he displaces it onto the next syllable, 
when he can:  ``and ME'' becomes ``an   dME'', and ``end LESS''  becomes ``en  
dLESS''.  So, the singer can effectively think of the sung phrase as:

YOU an  dME en dLESS lee

This doesn't cause confusion to listeners, because they're used to hearing it. 
 This does mean, however, that lyric placement does not provide an accurate barometer 
of where a word actually ends.   

In addition, the singer is singing fudging his vowels, like singers are taught 
to do,   so ``and'' and ``end'' sound almost indistinguishable.  So, really, what 
listeners are hearing is this:

YOU en dME en dLESS lee

Now, the listener's brain has to take this syllabic gobbldygook, and parse it into 
something useful.  They've currently got this mess to deal with (represented in 
SAMPA syllables):

ju En dmi En dl@s li

They parse the first part just fine, because the emphases match:

you and me En dl@s li

But no one says endLESSly.  People say ENDlessly.  So,  the listeners don't recognize 
it. they have to work with what they have.  They already turned one ``En d'' into 
an ``and'', so they do it again:

you and me and l@s li

Now, they're just left with LESS lee.  And that fits Leslie, a proper noun that 
fits in context and in emphasis placement.  So, the final heard lyric is:

you and me and Les- lie

The misunderstanding can be traced by to improper emphasis placement.  The songwriter 
probably didn't even think of that, and now he's stuck:  a one-hit-wonder with 
a misunderstood song.  I bet that in interview after interview, someone asks him 
who Leslie is.  It's probably very frustrating---especially since he could have 
just moved the word an eight note later, and it would have been understood perfectly. 
 That's the sort of situation this program is going to help avoid.\label{HToc197578261}

Comparison to Existing Systems:

Tra-la-lyrics\footnote{BIBLIOGRAPHY:

H.R. Oliveira, F.A. Cardoso, and F.C. Pereira, ``Tra-la-Lyrics: An approach to 
generate text based on rhythm,'' Proceedings of the 4th. International Joint Workshop 
on Computational Creativity, London, UK, 2007.} is the closest system that exists 
to the proposed system.  It takes lyrics in Portuguese, and matches them via emphases 
to the music.  This is different from our system, because our system will use English-language 
lyrics.

There are many systems that take lyrics and match them with notes, but very few 
use any sort of rhythmic rule set to do so\footnote{P. Bellini, I. Bruno, and P. 
Nesi, Multilingual Lyric Modeling and Management, Visual Perception of Music Notation: 
On-Line and Off-Line Recognition, edited by Dr. Susan E. George, press, 2003. ~ 
}.  Karaoke systems match lyrics to music on a time-based system, which is inadequate 
for our purposes.  However, the Wedelmusic model of a composition can be easily 
extended to include support for musical emphases, because of the way it separates 
out music and lyrics. Also, since it can be easily converted into an XML format, 
the composition can be transferred between programs, given the correct parser.\label{HToc197578262}

User Feedback:

I have no new user feedback.  I do, however, have some new requirements specification 
data from running my own trials on sample data.

Steps to Completion of Project:

(1) Acquire access to a linguistic database, where every word has at least the 
following attributes: 

--emphasis placement

--part of speech

--synonyms

(Optional:~ \texttt{"}mood\texttt{"}, if applicable)

(2)Find out precisely how to determine where the emphasis of a musical phrase lies, 
by emailing or asking some music professors at Cal Poly, and by independent research.

(3) Design parallel data structure representations for the textual and musical 
phrases.~ Figure out the best way to partition these so that they can still act 
independently, but so that they can still be compared.

(4) figure out how to compare the emphases in the text with the emphases in the 
music.~ 

(5) Make sure that the music fits some constraints:

-----the number of syllables in a textual phrase cannot exceed the number of notes 
in a musical phrase

-----A word can have more than one note, but a note cannot have more than one word.

-----The phrase, if we're generating lyrics, creates a sentence that makes sense, 
grammaticality. 

(5) Incorporate the interactive component, by allowing a user to (in no particular 
order):

-----modify the notes in a phrase, by making them longer, transposing them, or 
deleting them, etc (see DANCING NOTE COMPOSER)

-----allow selection of notes and note phrases

-----allow selection of words, and replacement with synonyms, or entered text

-----allow users to change the distribution of notes-to-words, giving some indication 
of whether or not the song is breaking the rules of emphases.\pagebreak{}\label{HToc120798037}\label{HToc197578264}

System Design:

Currently, my project prototype is a series of excel spreadsheets, partially generated 
from manual input and input from .csv files, which were partially generated by 
some command-line text parsing. \label{HToc120798038}\label{HToc197578265}

Prototype and Implementation\label{HToc120798039}\label{HToc197578266}

Syllable Structure

As a reminder, a syllable has a nucleus, a coda, and an onset.  The nucleus consists 
of a vowel (or semivowel), the coda consists of zero to four consonant phones, 
and the onset consists of zero to three consonant phones.\label{HToc120798040}\label{HToc197578267}

Length and Weight of Individual Phones

I've developed several tables to determine the weight and length of individual 
phones, divided by type.\label{HToc120798041}\label{HToc197578268}

\end{longtable}

Vowels, unlike consonants, do not have any sort of sub-variables to make extensive 
calculations necessary.  A vowel can be long, short, a semivowel, or a diphthong. 
A long vowel weighs more than a short vowel, which weighs about the same as a semivowel. 
 A diphthong's weight/length is just the sum of its parts.  A diphthong is a combination 
of two vowels or semivowels.  You just add the lengths/weights of its members to 
get its value.\pagebreak{}\label{HToc120798042}\label{HToc197578269}

Consonants

Consonants have a few variables that affect their weight.  

First, ``manner of articulation'': plosives, affricates, and fricatives weigh the 
most, with plosives being the heaviest (effectively, though, they're the same weight). 
 Nasals, laterals, approximants, and semivowels are all effectively ``weightless'', 
in and of themselves. 

Second, voicing:  to ``voice'' a phone means to cause the vocal chords to vibrate. 
 ``Voiced'' phones are singable, whereas ``voiceless'' phones are not.  ``Voiceless'' 
phones are really nothing more than a hiss, or directing streams of escaping air.

Third, the manner of starting and ending a sound has a bearing on weight.  A ``block'' 
means that you must fully stop airflow through the mouth to make the correct noise 
to start the sound. A block is basically a buildup-then-release of a stream of 
air.  ``Continuous frication'' is simply a continuous release of a directed air 
stream, without the primarily buildup.  An ``end'', which is the only type of start/end 
that I made up a name for, is a variation of a block without the full stop of airflow 
through the mouth. It's a distinctive change in the sound of a phone, but does 
not ``build up'' the air stream; it
