This project aims to facilitate semi-automated composition of melody and accompanying lyrics, by way of matching the musical emphases of a piece with the textual emphases of the lyrical phrases. The program will ultimately rely upon user input for "fitness" criteria, but will initially match lyrics with melodies based upon some rules.</p>

This program will be used as a compositional aid by anyone who wants to write songs and make them sound good, technically.  Its should allow the song writer to focus on more subjective criteria of what makes a song “good”, because it will make the structural rules of lyric composition immediately apparent.

Tra-la-lyrics is the closest system that exists to the proposed system.  It takes lyrics in Portuguese, and matches them via emphases to the music.  This is different from our system, because our system will use English-language lyrics.<br/>

Just like the weight of phones cannot be fully quantified in isolation, syllable length/weight is affected by surrounding syllables.<br/>
If a syllable’s last phone is the same as the next syllable’s first phone, then it you can disregard the weight of one of them.  Singers often only sing one of them, and use it for both words. For example:  Bake cookies becomes : bay-cookies  Stars shining becomes : star-shining.  Yelp peppers becomes: yell-...</p>

A syllable has a syllable nucleus, an optional onset and an optional coda. <br/>
The syllable nucleus is the anchor of the syllable, and as such, is typically the sound that a singer will “hold” while on a note.  It is normally a vowel, but can also be a sonorant, or “singable” consonant, like m, n, l, or r, if no vowel exists.  All syllables must have nuclei, for the purposes of this project.<br/>

Though syllable weight is a generally infinite relative scale, there are three main classifications of syllable weight:  Light, Heavy, and SuperHeavy.  Some important indicators of a long, or heavy, syllable are as follows:<br/>
1. a long vowel in the nucleus<br/>
2. a dipthong/tripthong in the nucleus<br/>
3. one or more coda.<br/>
This means that the two main things we need to look at when determining syllable weight and length are vowel type in the nucleus, and coda complex...</p>

Similar to iambic pentameter in a Shakespearian sonnet, music (even when devoid of words) has a repeatable ebb and flow to its emphases.  This is called “meter”.  It is actually remarkable similar to poetic meter (which is why they share the same term).  Most music is patterned with the emphasis on the first part of a beat.  So, if we have a measure of  four quarter notes, the count would go like this:<br/>

Parsable Dictionary<br/>
I started off by looking at MIT’s .  Eventually, I was led to a paper that, while not really related to my topic, had a list of phonetic dictionaries in it: CMU dictionary, LC-STAR dictionary and UNISYN dictionary.  I started out by looking at the LC-STAR dictionary, but I quickly decided that it wasn’t going to be as useful to me, because the LC-Star project is relatively focused on Speech-to-Speech or Text-to-Speech tech. Also, the website had ...</p>

I used the UNISYN dictionary, using General American SAMPA output, as the base for my phonetic dictionary.  <br/>
First, I downloaded the dictionary and related files from the UNISYN website.<br/>
Once I’d extracted them, I attempted to run the provided perl scripts to turn the UNISYN phonetic symbols into SAMPA phonetic symbols, using the procedure specified in Section 6.1 of their Documentation1_3.pdf, and towncode “gam”.<br/>
There were a few errors in translation I fixed ma...</p>

For the second iteration of Melody Matcher, we used a rule-based system based on CLIPS and C++, so some adjustments had to be made.  We decided that, instead of a Dictionary class which populated itself upon construction, we would store the dictionary words as CLIPS facts.  <br/>
I created a template for a "word" fact as the primary housing for my dictionary entries.<br/>

As per my original schedule for completion, I do not yet have a program prototype.  I felt it was more important to get the data format nailed down, because it’s the majority of the problem.  Also important at this point was finding a usable dictionary, separated by syllables and pronunciation.</p>

Again, the research and development of the algorithm has taken much more time than I thought it would. At this point, my goal is to get some sort of demonstration of the algorithm together by Week 10, along with full documentation of how it works.<br/>

Currently, Melody Matcher has two partial implementations.  One is rule-based, using the CLIPS system, and one uses conditional equations embedded in an Excel Spreadsheet.  In the following section, I explain the advantages and disadvantages of both. Ultimately I decided that, for the exploratory iteration of my project, a rule-based system is better than a purely equation-based one.</p>

Easy Modification Due to Modularization<br/>
A rule-based approach using templates and facts allows for less-messy modification of all components.  If an end user decides that they want a song to be deliberately ambiguous-sounding at a certain point, they can disable certain rules for that section.  If I decide that the phone "jU" needs to be categorized as a syllabic consonant instead of a semivowel, all I have to do is go into the fact that uses phone template to s...</p>

This is the approach that I started with, not so much because it was the best fit, but because it fit the medium I was using (Excel Spreadsheet).  There are, however, several reasons that an equation-based approach might be preferred.<br/>

Since Melody Matcher's fundamental concepts are still in constant revision, the easy modifiability provided by a rule-based approach makes it the optimal choice.  Eventually, once I've nailed down all the intricacies of how a lyric is built and structured, I might want to move to an equation-based approach, so that I could maybe incorporate my work into a complement to Harmonic Theory.  As things stand now, though,  I don't have confidence that I've fully...</p>

Melody Matcher aims to replicate the human ability to identify lyrics in a song that are easily misheard.  Lyrics can be misunderstood due to:<br/>
 • Lyric/Music emphasis mismatch, due to:<br/>
 ⁃ Note intervals<br/>
 ⁃ Phrase emphases <br/>
 ⁃ Word emphases<br/>
 • Word "cramming", due to <br/>
 ⁃ syllable lengths that exceed that of note length<br/>
