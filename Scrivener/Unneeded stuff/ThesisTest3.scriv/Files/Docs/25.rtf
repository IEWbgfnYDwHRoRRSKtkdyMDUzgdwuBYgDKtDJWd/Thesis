\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 Steps to Completion of Project:
\b0 \uc0\u8232 \u8232 (1) Acquire access to a linguistic database, where every word has at least the following attributes: \u8232 --emphasis placement\u8232 --part of speech\u8232 --synonyms\u8232 (Optional:\'a0 "mood", if applicable)\u8232 \u8232 (2)Find out precisely how to determine where the emphasis of a musical phrase lies, by emailing or asking some music professors at Cal Poly, and by independent research.\u8232 \u8232 (3) Design parallel data structure representations for the textual and musical phrases.\'a0 Figure out the best way to partition these so that they can still act independently, but so that they can still be compared.\u8232 \u8232 (4) figure out how to compare the emphases in the text with the emphases in the music.\'a0 \u8232 \u8232 (5) Make sure that the music fits some constraints:\u8232 -----the number of syllables in a textual phrase cannot exceed the number of notes in a musical phrase\u8232 -----A word can have more than one note, but a note cannot have more than one word.\u8232 -----The phrase, if we're generating lyrics, creates a sentence that makes sense, grammaticality. \u8232 \u8232 (5) Incorporate the interactive component, by allowing a user to (in no particular order):\u8232 -----modify the notes in a phrase, by making them longer, transposing them, or deleting them, etc (see DANCING NOTE COMPOSER)\u8232 -----allow selection of notes and note phrases\u8232 -----allow selection of words, and replacement with synonyms, or entered text\u8232 -----allow users to change the distribution of notes-to-words, giving some indication of whether or not the song is breaking the rules of emphases.}
