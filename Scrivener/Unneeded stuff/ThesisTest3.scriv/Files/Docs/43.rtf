\f1\b0\fs24 \cf0 I had not thought of the issue of note-length/weight vs. syllable-length/weight when matching lyrics to music, but came to my attention during the literature review. The general idea is that it takes longer to say some sounds than it does others, and that some sounds flow better into one sound as opposed to another.  I\'92ve decided that this is important enough for the success of the project that I need to include it, and figure out the rules involved.}
