\b0 \cf0 Though most of "Strawberry Fields Forever" is in 4/4 time, the chorus, where this lyric is taken from, is a waltz, in \'be time.  So, the Music BRS is "1 \'96 0 \'96 0 \'96, 1 \'96  0 \'96 0 \'96 "\
Notes on "
\i \cf2  Straw-\cf3  be-\cf4  rry
\i0 \cf0  ":  The secondary emphasis on "
\i \cf3 be-
\i0 \cf0 " slightly complicates this word.  Though the primary emphasis on "
\i \cf2  Straw-\cf3  
\i0 \cf0 " matches up with the emphasized beat in the music BRS, the secondary emphasis is on an un-emphasized beat.  While it's alright for unemphasized syllables to be on emphasized notes normally, in this situation, since the next syllable "
\i \cf4  rry
\i0 \cf0  " is even 
\i less
\i0  emphasized than "
\i \cf3  be- 
\i0 \cf0 ", we shouldn't have them on the same emphasis level if we want to avoid ambiguity.  This is where note intervals come in!  To compliment the fact both "
\i \cf3  be- 
\i0 \cf0 " and "
\i \cf4  rry
\i0 \cf0  " are less emphasized than the syllables before them, they both have negative note intervals, so it  sounds right!\
Notes on "
\i  For- \cf2 e- \cf3 ver
\i0 \cf0  " :  If this wasn't in \'be time, the Lyric BRS and Music BRS wouldn't match up, but it still would be correct, since the note intervals mirror the syllable emphases.}
