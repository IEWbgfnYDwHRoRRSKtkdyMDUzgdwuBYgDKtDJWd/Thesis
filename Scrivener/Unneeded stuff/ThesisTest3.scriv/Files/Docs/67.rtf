\f0\i\b\fs28 \cf0 Verdict on Rule-Based vs Equation-Based \

\f1\i0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Since Melody Matcher's fundamental concepts are still in constant revision, the easy modifiability provided by a rule-based approach makes it the optimal choice.  Eventually, once I've nailed down all the intricacies of how a lyric is built and structured, I might want to move to an equation-based approach, so that I could maybe incorporate my work into a complement to Harmonic Theory.  As things stand now, though,  I don't have confidence that I've fully understood and quantified the structure of a song lyric.   My equation-based approach is a spaghetti-like mess.  You know the movie "Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs"?  There's this spaghetti tornado. That's what my equations are like.  They're a twisted and tangled together, and they get unneeded objects stuck in them.  Okay, it's not a perfect metaphor. I'm just saying, it's not pretty.}
