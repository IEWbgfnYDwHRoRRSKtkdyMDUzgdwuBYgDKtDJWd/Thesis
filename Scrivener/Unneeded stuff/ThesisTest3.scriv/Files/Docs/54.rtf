Notes on "
\i \cf3 ning
\i0 \cf0 ": It's okay for unemphasized syllables to be on emphasized beats, so long as the new emphasis pattern doesn't match that of an existing word, and so long as the emphasized syllables in the same word are also on emphasized beats.\
Notes on "
\i \cf6 de-
\i0 \cf0 ": This syllable is emphasized, but the first beat that it falls on is not an emphasized beat.  There are a few possible reasons why this might be true:\

\cf0 (1) The note interval of "
\i \cf6 de-
\i0 \cf0 " is positive, so the emphasis is positive. \
	--More correctly, since note intervals refer to the change in pitch between a syllable's note and the \ul preceding\ulnone  note, we'd want to look at "
\i vil
\i0 " to see if the word "\cf6  de-\cf0  
\i vil
\i0  " was emphasized correctly. When we do, we find that "
\i vil
\i0 " has a negative note interval, so it's less emphasized than "
\i \cf6 de-
\i0 \cf0 ", so everything is hunky-dory!\
(2) The note that "
\i \cf6 de-
\i0 \cf0 "  is associated with continues through an emphasized beat, so it's emphasized.  \
(3) The slightly longer length of the note associated with "
\i \cf6 de-
\i0 \cf0 " makes it emphasized.\

\cf0 Since I'm focusing on the effects of note intervals right now, we're going to appoint that as the main cause.}
