\f0\fs26 \cf2 \cb3 Here are sunburst diagrams for the oronyms of the phrase "I stink". "I stink" has five different oronyms: "iced ink", "ay stink", "aye stink", "eye stink" and "I stink". The five different outer segments (which are easier to see on the equal-weighted sunburst diagram) represent the end word of each of those oronyms. The sunburst diagram that uses the frequency metric (which looks like a purple bullseye) shows that people are overwhelmingly more likely to hear "I stink" than any other possible oronym.}
