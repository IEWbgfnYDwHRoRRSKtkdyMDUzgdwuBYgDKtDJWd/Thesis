\f0\fs28 \cf0 In this project, we developed visual representation of the phonetic ambiguity of written prose. Given any valid English phrase, our system will first generate all possible correct phonetic sequences for a General American Accent. Then, it parses through these phonetic transcriptions depth-first, looking for valid orthographic words for each subsequent phonetic subsequence, generating full and partial phrases from these words.  While it is doing so, a tree branch is generated on screen for each possible orthographic divergence. Each branch segment represents an orthographic word, and the branch radius is scaled to the words\'92 frequency of use in everyday language.  Each branch has its own copy of its subsequent phonetic sequence. In the event that a orthographic branch\'92s phonetic \'93tail\'94 is not orthographically interpretable, we visually \'93dead-end\'94 the branch with a red sphere.  }
