\b0 \cf0 Notes on "
\i \cf3  \cf4 gui-\cf5  tar\cf6  
\i0 \cf0 ":  The first syllable of the word "guitar"  is emphasized, but the beat that that syllable is on is unemphasized.  We overcome this by checking the emphasized syllable, "
\i \cf5  tar\cf6  
\i0 \cf0 ".  Since "
\i \cf5  tar\cf6  
\i0 \cf0 " has a positive note interval, the word is still correctly emphasized. Hooray!  \
Notes on "
\i \cf3  \cf6 gent- \cf0 ly
\i0  ": Again here, the word's emphasis pattern doesn't match the emphasis pattern in the music.  When we then check the intervals for both syllables, we find they both are negative. This isn't a problem, though.  Since a note interval refers to the relationship of a note to the note preceding it, we only have to look at the second syllable of the world, "
\i  ly
\i0  ".  Since "
\i  ly
\i0  " has a negative interval, it's less emphasized then "
\i \cf3  \cf6 gent
\i0  \cf0 " in the song, which is exactly what we want.}
