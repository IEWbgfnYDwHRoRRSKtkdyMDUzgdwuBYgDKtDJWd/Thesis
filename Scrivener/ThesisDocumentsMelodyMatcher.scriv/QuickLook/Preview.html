Melody Matcher aims to replicate the human ability to identify lyrics in a song that are easily misheard.  Lyrics can be misunderstood due to:<br/>
 • Lyric/Music emphasis mismatch, due to:<br/>
 ⁃ Note intervals<br/>
 ⁃ Phrase emphases <br/>
 ⁃ Word emphases<br/>
 • Word "cramming", due to <br/>
 ⁃ syllable lengths that exceed that of note length<br/>

I started off by looking at MIT’s .  Eventually, I was led to a paper that, while not really related to my topic, had a list of phonetic dictionaries in it: CMU dictionary, LC-STAR dictionary and UNISYN dictionary.

A syllable has a syllable nucleus, an optional onset and an optional coda. These parts are all formed of phonemes, which are discrete sound fragments. We’ll go into those more later.<br/>
The syllable nucleus is the anchor of the syllable, and as such, is typically the sound that a singer will “hold” while on a note.  It is normally a vowel, but can also be a sonorant, or if no vowel exists, a “singable” consonant, like m, n, l, or r.  All syllables must have nuclei....</p>

Just like the weight of phones cannot be fully quantified in isolation, syllable length/weight is affected by surrounding syllables.<br/>
If a syllable’s last phone is the same as the next syllable’s first phone, then it you can disregard the weight of one of them.  Singers often only sing one of them, and use it for both words.

Though syllable weight is a generally infinite relative scale, there are three main classifications of syllable weight:  Light, Heavy, and SuperHeavy.  Some important indicators of a long, or heavy, syllable are as follows:<br/>
1. a long vowel in the nucleus<br/>
2. a dipthong/tripthong in the nucleus<br/>

Melody Matcher is a semi-automated music composition support program. It analyzes English lyrics along with a melody, and alerts the composer of the locations in the song where the lyrics are not deterministically understandable.

Similar to iambic pentameter in a Shakespearian sonnet, music (even when devoid of words) has a repeatable ebb and flow to its emphases.  This is called “meter”.  It is actually remarkable similar to poetic meter (which is why they share the same term).  Most music is patterned with the emphasis on the first part of a beat.  So, if we have a measure of  four quarter notes, the count would go like this:<br/>
1-and 2-and 3-and 4-and<br/>
The emphasis would go like this:<br/>

Music BRS<br/>
Music BRS's are pretty simple:  either a beat is emphasized, or it isn't.  If a beat is emphasized, you represent it with a "1".  If it's not, it's a "0".  A simple, 4/4 time measure would have this music BRS:<br/>
1 – 0 – 1 – 0<br/>
In the above example, the first and third beats are emphasized, whereas the second and fourth are not.<br/>

A “note interval” is a change in pitch between two notes.  Note intervals are one of the most noticeable factor in figuring out if a lyric matches a musical emphasis.  They also have the most direct analogy to lyrical emphases.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I have been representing the pattern of musical emphases as constant binary rhythmic sequences.  In a binary rhythmic sequence, the number "1" is used to represent an emphasized beat, and "0" repr...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Evaluating Correctness of Note Intervals</strong><br/>Evaluating Correctness of Note Intervals<br/>
To evaluate the fitness of note intervals, you need three things:<br/>
(1) The meter of the piece and its implied binary rhythmic sequence (BRS) <br/>
(2) The list of Syllables<br/>
(3) The list of Notes.<br/>
In our example, "The Bad Touch", the meter is 4/4, so the music BRS is the basic "1 – 0 – 1 – 0 ", which (again) is delightfully repetitive.  We already parsed in the lyrics, so we also have a list of Notes and Syllables. We're ready to start!<br/>
