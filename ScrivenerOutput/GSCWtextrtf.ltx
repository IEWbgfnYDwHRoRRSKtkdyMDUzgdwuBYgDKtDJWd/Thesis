{\large Abstract:}

\parindent=0pt
\textit{Melody }Matcher is a semi-automated music composition support program. 
It analyzes English lyrics along with a melody, and alerts the composer of the 
locations in the song where the lyrics are not deterministically understandable. 
Basically, it's grammar- and spell-check for songs. This is significant, because 
very little research has been done specifically on the quantifiable measurement 
of English-language lyric intelligibility, other than our project.

\vspace{14pt}
{\large Melody Matcher aims to replicate the human ability to identify lyrics in 
a song that are easily misheard. We started on this project, thinking that there 
would be carefully-specified research on how lyrics match melodies, mathematically. 
As it turned out, there was very little objective literature on the subject. Because 
of the lack of objective information of the subject, we had to develop our method 
from scratch. As we progressed through our work, we went from thinking that understandability 
depended only on emphasis-matching, to realizing that syllable length played a 
huge part as well, to realizing that there are many other musical, harmonic, and 
linguistic factors.}

several root causes:}

{\large . The fully-implemented Melody Matcher program will eventually take into 
account all of these causes of unintelligibility. In this abstract, we will focus 
on lyric/emphasis mismatch, which has already been implemented and is fully functional 
in primary testing. The other sections have been implemented, but are not fully 
tested and/or integrated into the main program.}

{\large \textit{A. Target Audience and Goals}}

{\large This program is to be used as a compositional aid by anyone who wants to 
write songs and make them sound good, technically. It should allow the song writer 
to focus on more subjective criteria of what makes a song ``good'', because it 
will make the structural rules of lyric composition immediately apparent.}

{\large Our hope for this project is that it will be useful to burgeoning songwriters, 
who have the creative spark to make wonderfully poetic lyrics, but lack the ``ear'' 
to match their lyrics successfully to music. It should be particularly helpful 
to songwriters who place a high emphasis on understandability of lyrics (such as 
parody song writers, or lyricists for musical theater).}

{\large Additionally, Melody Matcher will be useful for songwriters for whom English 
is a second language. While they may be a master lyricist in their native language, 
writing lyrics in English can be a particular challenge, since so much of lyric-writing 
is dependent upon knowing the cadence of the language you're writing lyrics in, 
and since English has no easily-discernible rules for emphasis placement in words.}

{\large II. PRACTICAL EXAMPLE }OF {\large UNDERLYING THEORY}

{\large The structural rules of lyric placement are important, because without 
them, lyrics can become muddled and/or unin- telligible. For example, in the song 
}{\large \textit{``Groovin' (on a Sunday Afternoon)'', }}{\large by the Young Rascals, 
there's a part in the bridge that many people hear as }{\large \textit{``Life would 
be ecstasy, you an' me an' Leslie''. }}{\large In fact, the line is }{\large \textit{``Life 
would be ecstasy, you and me endlessly''. }}{\large The confusion lies with the 
last three syllables of the phrase. The pronunciation of each version, if spoken 
normally, is as follows:}
