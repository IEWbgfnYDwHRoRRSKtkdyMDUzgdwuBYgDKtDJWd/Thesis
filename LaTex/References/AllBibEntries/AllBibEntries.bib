{‘The} prophet idle reins’ we heard one pray to the knight…
Insight allowed to awaken, unabridged, to know where
The profit-idol reigns. Th’wee herd won prey to the night

The morphine needle in vein, juice taken of phial, metal-panel altar,
Ire call! Soar! The heroin trepidation is meant, all percept shun. F-u-c-k all!
The more fine need all in vain, just akin of file, mettle, pain- all alter’d.
I recall th’sword-hero, intrepid, ashen, his mental perception focal

Or wholly him? Blue eye barred the fair-haired Gael seen
In me call the quire, buoy, isle, seaboard. {‘Contempt} in
Our holy hymn’ Blew I! {‘Bard!} The fare hared gale scene! ’
Inimical, the choir boy, I’ll see bored contemplating.

Hear the foaled fowl freeze in whole gait truly knowing
The soul of the son, the heir to riches. But know more…
Here the fold foul frieze in-hole {gate-True.} Lie now in
The sole of the sun. The air, too, rich is but no more.

Ewe –not one, but two {…Four} - Give the week’s gambol
That eight ants would wade desert flower bolls.
You not won! But to forgive the weak’s gamble
That ate aunt’s wood-weighed dessert flour bowl.

Our weather blew! Two more roes soar- {‘Oh}, to get her… Oui! ’
{‘New!} Lo! Seize the day! Dream suckers! ’ Me: aweigh gnaw’d
Or whether blue? Tomorrows sorrow: Together we
Knew low seas. The daydream succours me away now.},

	abstract = {Amazon’s Mechanical Turk {(AMT)} is a Web application that provides instant access to thousands of potential participants for survey-based psychology experiments, such as the acceptability judgment task used extensively in syntactic theory. Because {AMT} is a Web-based system, syntacticians may worry that the move out of the experimenter-controlled environment of the laboratory and onto the user-controlled environment of {AMT} could adversely affect the quality of the judgment data collected. This article reports a quantitative comparison of two identical acceptability judgment experiments, each with 176 participants (352 total): one conducted in the laboratory, and one conducted on {AMT.} Crucial indicators of data quality—such as participant rejection rates, statistical power, and the shape of the distributions of the judgments for each sentence type—are compared between the two samples. The results suggest that aside from slightly higher participant rejection rates, {AMT} data are almost indistinguishable from laboratory data.},
